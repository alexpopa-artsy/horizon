Visual representations of release pipelines.

TO DO
---
* ~~Support hokusai~~
* Better visual
* ~~Allow SSH keys to be configured for each org or project (probably like `git config --local core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/some_key_file"`...). (Maybe not necessary given github/heroku tokens in https URLs)~~
* ~~sanitize URLs with tokens/credentials in them~~
* ~~instead of including tokens in each git URL, define "profiles" associated with each organization and project~~
* Experiment with programmatic git/hokusai access instead of shelling out
* button to refresh project on-demand
* Fix ugly AWS credentials -> hokusai flow
